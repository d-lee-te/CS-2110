# CS 2110 - Computer Organization and Programming (Fall 2021)
I took CS 2110 @ Gatech in the Fall 2021.

Lectured by Caleb Southern.

## About
[Official course listing page](https://oscar.gatech.edu/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=202402&subj_code_in=CS&crse_numb_in=2110).

The introduction of the class was taught with Java. The first majority half of the semester was taught using Assembly, and the second half of the class was taught using C.

### Course Curriculum
1. To understand the structure and operation of a modern computer from the ground up
2. Understand basic hardware concepts: digital circuits, gates, bits, bytes, number representation
3. Understand the Von Neumann model and the structure and operation of a basic data path
4. Understand the structure and function machine language instructions
5. Understand the structure and function of a symbolic assembly language
6. Understand basic concepts of computer systems such as the runtime stack, simple I/O devices
7. Introduce the C language with particular emphasis on the underlying assembly and machine language as well as interaction with hardware

### Assignments
1. Bitwise Operations - Bitshifts, bitwise interactions with operators

**Using Circuitsim**

2. ALU - Create logic gates, 8-input multiplxer, 8-output decoder, 8-bit full adder, and construct 8-bit ALU
3. FSM (Finite State Machine) - Build a register and implement a one-hot state machine, complete a K-Map and simplify state machine circuit, reduce state machine, build PC (program counter) register
4. LC-3 Datapath (assignment state machine as presented in class textbook) - Program microcode given a spreadsheet and tested using a psuedo ROM in the subcircuit of the LC3. 

**W/o Circuitsim** (i.e. independent of ongoing LC-3 construction)

5. Assembly Programming - Implement functions in assembly
    - Square a number
    - Modify an array
    - Remove vowels
    - Toggle case of letters

**Using Circuitsim**

6. Subroutines and stack/memory manipulation
    - Collatz Conjecture
    - Selection Sort
    - (Recursive) Linked List Sum

**W/o Circuitsim** (i.e. independent of ongoing LC-3 construction)

7. C Programming - Implement a database using structs, pointer, and arrays in C
8. C game for [GBA (Game Boy Advance) emulator](https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/)
    - Access and control devices memory-mapped I/O
    - Display graphics timing w/ Vblank
    - Optimize performance for limited hardware devices using DMA and integer math
9. LinkedList
    - Memory allocation practice
10. Malloc, Calloc, Realloc, Free practice
    - Breakdown of how these memory functions work on the stack
    - Block allocation and metadata
    - Splitting and storing data in a freelist

### Debrief
I struggled immensely in this class, but I loved it. 

On one hand, I got my first taste of machine languages and learned to hate Assembly. 

On the other hand, I built a virtual circuit computer from scratch with working subroutines, and I managed to make a basic GBA game while juggling the rest of my assignments and classes at the time. 

Truly a love-hate experience where I felt under pressure from attempting to learn and work with new languages effectively in record time, but also having the chance to build something I would never have thought to independently pursue. 

# Disclaimer
As most of the course content belongs to either the College or the Professors, I am transcribing my work and assignments to record the course.

As such, many assignments and files **may not include detailed descriptions or solutions**. This is done to avoid violations, avoid doxing myself and others, and any number of other reasons. If, for any reason, the full repo must be accessed, all assignments, descriptions, solutions, and class files are stored in a private version of the repo (so contact me. If you're a current student, don't bother since I won't give you access and it wouldn't help you anyway xp).

If possible, portions of the class will be linked to a separate readme explaining more about the linked assignment/solution/description/other.

If there exist any honor code violations or any problems/solutions are *too* in-depth, please contact me. The intention of each public class repo is to record my experience and assignments of each class taken.
